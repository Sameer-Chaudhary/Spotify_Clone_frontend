# Spotify_Clone_frontend
A Spotify-inspired web music player built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on clean UI, interactive controls, and dynamic audio handling. The project replicates core Spotify-like functionality while implementing custom logic.
Note: Audio files are not included in this repository due to GitHub file size limits.
